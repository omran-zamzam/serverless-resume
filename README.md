# Introduction

The goal is to create your very own resume and publish it as a public website. For this you are going to use AWS serverless technologies.

The solution will look similar to the following diagram. You will use Amazon S3 static website storage to publish your static site. By using CloudFront, your newly created resume website will be delivered more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content. A nice side effect is that it allows you to securely deliver your website via SSL.

In order for the visitors to get in touch with you, you will need a contact form. Since S3 static website storage does not allow dynamic content, you will make use of AWS Lambda functions to provide this functionality. Completing the form will trigger an AWS Lambda function which in turn sends you an email with the form content. Sending the email is done by using Amazon Simple Email Service. Check out an example of a resume webiste if you want to see it in action.  [https://d1hv5lii4xzlzo.cloudfront.net/](https://d1hv5lii4xzlzo.cloudfront.net/)

## Some important side notes

* Since your accounts are only allowed to create resources in the EU (Frankfurt) eu-central-1 region, make sure you change the region accordingly. Always select **region EU (Frankfurt) eu-central-1** to deploy your resource.
* Students cannot create or modify identity and access related configuration in the Powercoders AWS account. Therefor the necessary Lambda execution roles required to complete this lab have already been created for you. In case you are working on this lab in your own AWS account you will need to create the corresponding Lambda execution role and assign it the corresponding policies to access CloudWatch and Amazon SES.

## More information about Cloud and AWS

If you want to get familiar with essential AWS concepts and services. There are plenty of free training sessions available on [AWS training and certification](https://aws.training) or Youtube. You will need a (free) Amazon account for this.

Login with your AWS credentials and get familiar with the [AWS console](https://powercoders.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=eu-central-1).

Let the teacher know if you were able to login and browse the AWS console. Check out [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html) which will help you to get started with the AWS console.

# Step 1 - Create your HTML resume

First of all you need a resume. Some great examples of static websites built with HTML and CSS can be found [here](https://html5up.net/). All the templates you find there are 100% Free under the \
[Creative Commons](https://html5up.net/license) license. This means you may use them but you need to give HTML5 UP credit for the design. There is a note in the footer section of the website that mentions HTML5 UP.

This lab is based on the [Read Only template from HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/read-only) so it is recommended to use this one. The template contains a simple contact form which you are going to use later on.

For this lab we will use a a slightly modified version of the above mentioned template and adopt it to represent your resume. You can download the template from [this github repository](darthvader-resume-template/).

The following modifications were added to the template to match the requirements for this lab:
* A [JavaScript function](darthvader-resume-template/assets/js/contact.js) was added which posts the message from the contact form to your API
* A modified form  


You might want to add a profile pic and some basic information about you. Adjust the _index.html_ file accordingly and replace the images in the _images_ folder if you want to. To check out your work you can launch index.html in your browser on your local machine.

To modify the template you can use whatever text editor you have. There are plenty of options out there which are free to use. Two great options to use are:

*   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Don‚Äôt spend too much time on your resume. It just serves as an example and you can still tweak it later on when it is online.

# Step 2 - Deploy your resume online

Deploy your resume online as an [Amazon S3 static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

You might want to complete the following training sessions to get some basic understanding of Amazon Simple Storage Service

*   [Introduction to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=32727) - 15min
*   [Foundation of Amazon S3](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=32728) - 35min

Whenever you are ready, start creating your resources. You can use [this walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html) to get started with static website hosting on Amazon S3

The walkthrough mentioned above is using _example.com_ as the name for the S3 bucket. To ensure you can better identify the correct resources later on in the lab, **please make sure you name your S3 bucket according to the following convention:**

```
powercoders-resume-<firstname><lastname> (e.g. powercoders-resume-darthvader)
```

üö® Some hints regarding the walkthrough:

*   Use `index.html `and `error.html` for your index and error document.
*   When adding the bucket policy which makes your bucket publicly accessible, make sure you replace _example.com_ with the name of your bucket. Otherwise you will see an error that says `Policy has invalid resource`
*   In Step 5 of the walkthrough you do not have to create an index.html file since you already created your resume website in step 1 of this lab. Just upload the content of your website folder including all subfolders

Document the resources you created and let the teacher know the S3 Static Website URL where your resume website is available.

If your resume is available online and you still want to explore Amazon S3 a little more you can 

*   [Add a custom error document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CustomErrorDocSupport.html) to further personalize your website

# Step 3 - Logging web traffic

Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to your bucket.

You can use [this walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/LoggingWebsiteTraffic.html) to get started with server access logging for your static website.

The walkthrough mentioned above is using _logs.example.com_ as the name for the S3 bucket. To ensure you can better identify the correct resources later on in the lab, **please make sure you name your S3 bucket according to the following convention:**

```
powercoders-accesslogs-<firstname><lastname> (e.g. powercoders-accesslogs-darthvader)
```

üö® Some hints regarding the walkthrough:

*   When asked to create a folder for the log files, create one named `logs` for the S3 buckets logs and another one named `cdn `for the CloudFront logs. The cdn folder is used in the next step of this lab
*   Access logging has to be activated on the previously created S3 bucket hosting your resume

Add the resources you created to the spreadsheet.

# Step 4 - Enable HTTPS for your website

The S3 website URL should use HTTPS for security. Since S3 does not support HTTPS connections out of the box you will need to use [Amazon CloudFront ](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)to help with this

You might want to complete the following training sessions to get some basic understanding of Amazon CloudFront and HTTPS

*   [What is HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/)
*   [Introduction to Amazon CloudFront](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=15891) - 10min

Whenever you are ready, start creating your resources. You can use [this walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.html) to get started with securing your website with Amazon CloudFront.

üö® Some hints regarding the walkthrough:

*   In Step 1 for the _Origin Domain Name_ select the correct S3 bucket you created in the previous step.
*   When configuring _Default Cache Behaviour Settings _in Step 5 make sure that you select _Redirect HTTP to HTTPS_ for the Viewer Protocol Policy \

![Cloud Front Viewer Protocol Policy Settings](images/CloudFront_ViewerProtocolPolicy.png)

*   When configuring _Default Cache Behaviour Settings _in Step 5 make sure that you select _GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE_ as the _Allowed HTTP Methods_ \

![Cloud Front Allowed HTTP Methods Settings](images/CloudFront_AllowedHTTPMethods.png)

*   Skip steps 6a and 6b in the walkthrough since we are not working with custom domain names for now.
*   When configuring _S3 Bucket for Logs _choose the S3 Log Bucket you created in the previous step.
*   As _Log Prefix _enter _cdn _to make use of the folder you created in the previous step.
*   The creation of the CloudFront distribution point can take up to 5 minutes

You can now securely access your website using the domain name of the newly created distribution point üëç

![Cloud Front Distributions](images/CloudFront_Distributions.png)

Add the resources you created to the spreadsheet and post the CloudFront URL on which your resume website is available in the Slack Channel.

ü•≥ Congratulations, you built your first static website using Amazon S3 and CloudFront!

# Step 5 - Send emails using Amazon SES

Now that you published your resume, you need a way to get in contact with you. This is where [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) comes into play. Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a flexible and scalable email service that enables you to send mail from within any application.

Setting up Amazon SES is quite simple:

*   [Verify an email address in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html) to which you want to send your emails. This is probably your own personal email address
*   Check if you are able to send and receive emails by [using the Amazon SES console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-an-email-from-console.html)

Send a test email to one of your classmates and the teacher using the AWS SES console.

# Step 6 - Create a Hello World REST API with Lambda and API Gateway

To be able to POST your contact form content and trigger the sending of an email, you will need to build a corresponding REST API. This can be done using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

You might want to complete the following training sessions to get some basic understanding of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway

*   [What is REST](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)
*   [Introduction to AWS Lambda](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=16360) - 10min
*   [AWS Lambda Foundations](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=27197) - 60min
*   [Introduction to Amazon API Gateway](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=16452) - 10min
*   [Amazon API Gateway for serverless applications](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=27199) - 75min

Whenever you are ready, start creating your resources. You can use [this walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html) to get started. It will guide you through the process of building a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù REST API with Lambda and API Gateway.

The walkthrough mentioned above is using_ GetStartedLambdaProxyIntegration_ as the name for the Lambda function and _LambdaSimpleProxy_ as the name for the API Gateway. To ensure you can better identify the correct resources later on in the lab, **please make sure you name your Lambda function according to the following convention:**

Lambda function: `powercoders-helloworld-<firstname><lastname> (e.g. powercoders-helloworld-darthvader)`

API Gateway: `powercoders-resumecontact-<firstname><lastname> (e.g powercoders-resumecontact-darthvader)`

üö® Some hints regarding the walkthrough:

* Use `Node.js 12.x `as runtime.
* When asked to create a new role instead _Use an existing role_ and select the role `powercocers-resumelab-lambdaexecutionrole`. 

![Lambda Execution Roles](images/Lambda_Permissions.png)

* Don't forget to hit _Deploy_ after every change to the Function code.
* Make sure that instead of naming your API resource _helloworld_ you create a resource named _rest_ and the corresponding _helloworld_ resource as a child resource. You will need this _rest_ resource in the next steps of this lab. Your resources should look like the following

![API Gateway resources and methods](images/ApiGateway_Helloworld_Resource.png)
* When deploying your API create a new deployment stage named _prod_ instead of _test_ as outlined in the walkthrough

Document the resources you created let your teacher know the URL where your Hello World REST API can be invoked.

# Step 7 - Send emails using AWS Lambda and API Gateway

Now that you have a working Hello World sample for a REST API with Lambda function, go ahead and try to adopt the sample to be able to send emails via Amazon SES. [This example from the JavaScript Developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/ses-examples-sending-email.html) will help to get you started.

Leave the existing Hello World example as is but create another Lambda function as you did in the previous step. This time, name it according to the following convention:

```
powercoders-sendemail-<firstname><lastname> (e.g. powercoders-sendemail-darthvader)
```

Instead of using the function code provided in the tutorial, get the [code from this Github repository](https://github.com/sjohner/serverless-resume-lab/blob/main/sendmail.js). Make sure you change the following:

*   The sender and recipient address need to match with the email address you registered with Amazon SES.
*   Change the _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ header to match with our CloudFront URL. This is necessary because the function is called from another origin. See [What is CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for more information.

After you created your new _sendemail_ function, you will have to extend the existing API Gateway with a new resource.

Get back to the walkthrough and create a new resource (Step 4 in the _Create a "Hello, World!" API_ section) as a child of your existing _rest_ resource. Instead of naming it _helloworld_, this time name it _contact_.

The contact resource needs some methods. But instead of adding an _ANY_ method to the new resource, add the following methods for your newly created _contact_ resource:

*   OPTIONS
*   POST

Now you should have two resources within your _rest_ resource.

![API Gateway resources and methods](images/ApiGateway_Contact_Resource.png)

üö® For both methods make sure that you integrate with the new sendemail Lambda function and that you check _Use Lambda Proxy integration_

Once you created and deployed your API, you can now test if you can send emails by using the API. Sample commands for testing the API with curl can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sjohner/6f521a7b262b1023ce21b9fca042fde9)

# Step 8 - Additional CloudFront origin for the contact API

The HTML contact form and the corresponding javascript to process will be served from your S3 bucket. However the processing of the form will be forwarded to your API Gateway. You will use a convention that anything under the path /rest/ will come from API Gateway. The default behavior will be to serve any other requests from our S3 bucket. To serve REST requests from API Gateway you are going to create a second Cloudfront origin.

From the _Origins_ tab select _Create Origin_. Enter the domain name and path of your API Gateway and make sure to select _HTTPS only_ for _Origin Protocol Policy_.

![CloudFront Origin](images/CloudFront_Origin.png)

# Step 9 - Add a contact form to your static website

Congrats, you are almost done! Last thing you need is to enhance the contact form to your static website.

To make your contact form work, you will need some JavaScript magic which sends the form input to your API. You can find a sample JavaScript function [here](darthvader-resume-template/assets/js/contact.js).

Copy the `contact.js` file to the `asstes/js` folder within your website project.

For the JavaScript code to work you need to do some minor tweaks in your index.html. See [here](darthvader-resume-template/index.html) for a complete sample of `index.html`.

*   Add the path to the script in the scripts section at the end of index.html
*   Add `onSubmit="return sendMessage(event)"" `to the form definition to make sure that submitting the form sends the message
*   Remove `method="post"` from the form definition

Now that you have a working contact form, upload the newly created JavaScript file and the updated index.html file.

ü•≥ Congratulations, you successfully completed this lab!
